This project uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Machine Learning techniques to evaluate whether Marcus Rashford would tactically and statistically fit into FC Barcelona's attacking setup.
To evaluate whether Marcus Rashford could be a tactical fit within Hansi Flick’s attacking system at Barcelona, we first need to understand the method behind the visual analysis used.
The approach is based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a statistical technique that reduces complex performance data into just two dimensions, Principal Component 1 (PC1) and Principal Component 2 (PC2).
These components capture the directions of greatest variation across a dataset of players: PC1 reflects the most significant difference in playing styles, while PC2 captures the second most significant, at a right angle to PC1.
In simpler terms, every player becomes a single dot on a two-dimensional plot, and their location reflects their performance profile about others.
To ensure fairness, all stats were converted to a “per 90 minutes” basis, so a player with 27 matches can be fairly compared with one who played 57.
The data was then standardised to remove any scale bias (goals shouldn’t outweigh passing simply due to larger numbers). PCA reduced the dataset to a simplified space where each player's style can be visually compared.
Rashford’s proximity—or lack thereof—to Barcelona’s existing forwards on the plot offers an early signal: is he stylistically aligned with the system, or will he require adaptation?
Now, to determine whether Marcus Rashford is likely to thrive in Hansi Flick’s attacking system at Barcelona, a data-driven comparison with the current front three, Lamine Yamal, Raphinha and Lewandowski, offers compelling insights.
